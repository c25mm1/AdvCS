# Project Title
PlanMyWeek
## Project Overview
An academic planner dividing up tasks, their respective lengths and deadlines. This project would read tasks and suggest lengths, generating a realistic schedule that can be adjusted based on people's habits or distraction levels. This project would also incorporate priority levels, ensuring that more urgent or important tasks are allocated adequate time, while less critical tasks are distributed evenly. Additionally, it would use machine learning to adapt to individual productivity patterns, optimizing the schedule based on past performance and predicted focus windows.
### Motivation
Why did you choose this project? What interests you about it, and how will it help you develop your
skills in computer science? I am trying to solve the problem of disorganization and help people better manage their busy schedules. The key features will include categories of tasks that need to be done and other ways of configuring data that might be utilized to organize people's tasks. I am interested in this idea because I think it will be useful for me and others in my community. This project tests a number of computer science skills, such as data structures/representation and styling. I can hone my skills in these mediums and use VSCode to combine them. Additionally, this project challenges me to improve my skills working with algorithms. It will require me to work on user interface design and experience, ensuring the planner is intuitive and easy to use. The need to process and organize tasks in a way that is efficient will also help me deepen my understanding of data manipulation.
## Project Breakdown
My project will include a homepage featuring categories of tasks which can be dragged and dropped into different buckets. The homepage will allow users to create custom task categories and assign priorities, making it easy to organize tasks based on type or urgency. The drag-and-drop function will enable users to quickly sort tasks into different time blocks or categories. There will also be a schedule page where tasks will populate and be adjusted into a calendar. There will be suggested lengths of events, which users can adjust with a slider. The slider for adjusting task durations will provide flexibility, allowing users to extend or shorten time for specific tasks based on their focus or fatigue levels.
## Tools and Technologies
The tools and technologies are just going to be programming languages as there is no physical hardwired component. JavaScript will be implemented for my project. I am interested in using Brain.js to integrate neural networking into JavaScript, since the two are highly compatible. Npm or yarn might be added to manage dependencies. I will test my project sporadically and debug. CSS will be used in HTML to style the UI.
## Resources
I don’t foresee using many resources external to JavaScript/VS Code. If time permits, I might integrate Google Calendar’s API so that users can sync events across platforms and can more see their availability.
