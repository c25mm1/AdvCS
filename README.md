# Project Title
PlanMyWeek
## Project Overview
An academic planner dividing up tasks, their respective lengths and deadlines. This project would read tasks and suggest lengths, generating a realistic schedule that can be adjusted based on people's habits or distraction levels.
### Motivation
Why did you choose this project? What interests you about it, and how will it help you develop your
skills in computer science? I am trying to solve the problem of disorganization and help people better manage their busy schedules. The key features will include categories of tasks that need to be done and other ways of configuring data that might be utilized to organize people's tasks. I am interested by this idea because I think it will be useful for me and others in my community. This project tests a number of computer science skills, such as data structures/representation and styling. I can hone my skills in these mediums and use VSCode to combine them.
## Project Breakdown
My project will include a homepage featuring categories of tasks which can be dragged and dropped into different buckets. There will also be a schedule page where tasks will populate.
## Tools and Technologies
The tools and technologies are just going to be programming languages as there is no physical hardwired component. JavaScript will be implemented for my project. I am interested in using Brain.js to integrate neural networking into JavaScript, since the two are highly compatible. I will test my project sporadically and debug.
## Resources
This project will not require many resources besides what was outlined in the tools and technologies section.
## Initial Backlog
- Research Blackbaud/dalton tasks and how that could be implemented
- Research other event planners
- Homepage design, Sketch UI
- Research Brain js to implement machine learning
- Brain.js add on
- Create a drag and drop interface using Brain js
- Code boilerplate/UI
- Test out relevant javascript functions that I can use
- Initital research on machine learning for predictive use
- Make a machine learning algorithm to suggest where tasks should go
- Create dropdowns that allow users to fill out different attributes for their tasks in the planner
- Generate my own list of recommended lengths of events and where they fit into a schedule
- Append to algorithm
